# Youssef Tajani
_PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence | INSEA Engineer (SDRO) | Data Science & Machine Learning_

## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Systems (LIAS), University Hassan II of Casablanca, and an INSEA Engineer in Decision Science and Operations Research (SDRO, Class of 2025).

My background combines applied machine learning, statistical modeling, and large-scale data engineering, with a strong focus on high-impact real-world problems in finance, risk, and industrial analytics.

I work on designing robust and interpretable AI systems for complex tabular data, particularly in settings where data is noisy, highly imbalanced, or heterogeneous.

## Research Interests
- Machine Learning for Tabular Data  
- Class Imbalance and Rare Event Modeling  
- Deep Learning for Structured Data  
- Statistical Learning and Optimization  
- Credit Risk, Fraud Detection, and Churn Modeling  
- AI for Industrial and Financial Systems  

## What I Do
My work sits at the intersection of:
- Machine learning research  
- Applied data science  
- Data engineering pipelines  

I design end-to-end ML systems, from:
- Raw data ingestion and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering and modeling  
- Model evaluation and benchmarking  
- Deployment-ready pipelines  

I particularly enjoy working on problems where model performance, statistical rigor, and real-world constraints must be balanced.

## Technical Skills
**Languages**  
- Python  

**Machine Learning & AI**  
- PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- Deep learning for tabular data  
- Classification, imbalance handling, evaluation metrics  

**Data & Engineering**  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Spark, Kafka pipelines  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  

**Research & Reporting**  
- LaTeX, Overleaf  
- Experimental design and statistical validation  

## Career & Research Vision
My long-term goal is to contribute to high-impact AI research that bridges the gap between theory and real-world deployment, particularly in:
- Financial risk and compliance  
- Fraud detection  
- Large-scale industrial decision systems  

I am especially interested in roles and collaborations that involve R&D, applied machine learning, and data-driven decision making.
